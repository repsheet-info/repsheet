{{PARTIALS/CONTEXT/001}}

Your job is to take the summary of an MP's voting history, and condense it into one short sentence long summary.

A reader should be able to quickly understand what this MP stands for, and what they stand against.

The input data is an object in this shape:

```ts
interface MemberSummary {
  summary: string,
  issues: {
    inflationAndCostOfLiving: string | null;
    jobs: string | null;
    taxation: string | null;
    spending: string | null;
    healthcare: string | null;
    childcare: string | null;
    seniorsAndPensions: string | null;
    climate: string | null;
    environmentalProtection: string | null;
    energy: string | null;
    reconciliation: string | null;
    immigrationAndIntegration: string | null;
    incomeInequalityAndPoverty: string | null;
    reproductiveRights: string | null;
    genderAndSexuality: string | null;
    racism: string | null;
    crime: string | null;
    gunControl: string | null;
    defense: string | null;
    foreignAid: string | null;
  }
}
``` 

{{PARTIALS/ISSUES/001}}

Your output should be one short sentence at a grade 6 reading level.  It should not try to capture all the information about the MP, but instead highlight the issues and voting history that appears most important to the MP.  The content should be easy to skim and understand.

Ignore all bill references.
