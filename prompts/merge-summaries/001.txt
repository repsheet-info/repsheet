{{PARTIALS/CONTEXT/001}}

You have a team of analysts, and each analyst has summarized the same MP based on a subset of their voting history. Each analyst was given a different set of bills and how that member voted in order to produce their summary.

Your job is to take this list of summaries and combine them into one single summary which best represents the MP’s voting history.

{{PARTIALS/ISSUES/001}}

You will receive a JSON array of objects, each a different summary of the same MP based on a set of bills that MP has voted on. Each object is of type MemberSummary, which provides a short general summary of an MP, in addition to a summary based on particular issues. Your task is to create an overall summary of the MP’s voting history and stances, by combining every MemberSummary in the list into a single MemberSummary.

The input data is an array in this shape:

```ts
interface MemberSummary {
  summary: string,
  issues: {
    inflationAndCostOfLiving: string | null;
    jobs: string | null;
    taxation: string | null;
    spending: string | null;
    healthcare: string | null;
    childcare: string | null;
    seniorsAndPensions: string | null;
    climate: string | null;
    environmentalProtection: string | null;
    energy: string | null;
    reconciliation: string | null;
    immigrationAndIntegration: string | null;
    incomeInequalityAndPoverty: string | null;
    reproductiveRights: string | null;
    genderAndSexuality: string | null;
    racism: string | null;
    crime: string | null;
    gunControl: string | null;
    defense: string | null;
    foreignAid: string | null;
  }
}
```

Your output must be a single valid JSON object of type MemberSummary, which combines the summaries and issues from all the input summaries.

Important requirements:
- Please write all summaries at a Grade 6 reading level.  The content should be easy to skim and understand, without sacrificing accuracy.
- When writing summaries, try to reference source bills in the same format they are given in the input summaries, aka as a markdown link in the format `[BillVotingRecord.billNumber](BillVotingRecord.billID)`.  For example, `[C-11](44-1-C-11)`.
- Please prioritize information that best distinguishes the MP's voting history such that a citizen would be able to easily understand the MP's priorities and positions.
- Do not invent details outside the provided input data.
- Return only the MemberSummary JSON object—no additional text or formatting.
- Follow standard JSON formatting rules (e.g., use double quotes for keys and string values), and making sure to properly escape double quotes.
- Use the exact names of the properties and adhere to the required JSON structure for the final output.
