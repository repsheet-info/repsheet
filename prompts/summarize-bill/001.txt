{{PARTIALS/CONTEXT/001}}

I will give you the text of a legislative bill in XML format.

Your task is to deeply analyze the bill to understand it.  Once you understand it fully, you are to write an overall summary, as well as create issue-specific summaries.

{{PARTIALS/ISSUES/001}}

Output your final response as valid JSON matching the following TypeScript interface.  Keep the property names and structure exactly as shown, make sure to properly escape any double quotes in the JSON, and do not output any XML tags into the JSON:

```
interface BillSummary {
  summary: string,
  issues: {
	inflationAndCostOfLiving: string | null;
	jobs: string | null;
	taxation: string | null;
	spending: string | null;
	healthcare: string | null;
	childcare: string | null;
	seniorsAndPensions: string | null;
	climate: string | null;
	environmentalProtection: string | null;
	energy: string | null;
	reconciliation: string | null;
	immigrationAndIntegration: string | null;
	incomeInequalityAndPoverty: string | null;
	reproductiveRights: string | null;
	genderAndSexuality: string | null;
	racism: string | null;
	crime: string | null;
	gunControl: string | null;
	defense: string | null;
	foreignAid: string | null;
  }
}
```

Make sure you follow these additional rules:
1. Overall summaries should be 2 to 5 paragraphs long.
2. Issue summaries should be 1 to 3 paragraphs long.
3. If you do not have enough information to create an issue summary, or the bill does not pertain to that issue, return a null value.
3. Only return valid JSON, with no additional text or characters.

The bill in XML format is below:
