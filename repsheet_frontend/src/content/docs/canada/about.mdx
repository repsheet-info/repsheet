## What is Repsheet?

Repsheet attempts to create an unbiased summary of all current Canadian MPs. We use AI summarization with MP voting record histories to attempt to create unbiased accounts of how MPs have voted.

## Who runs Repsheet?

Repsheet is a side project created by Will Sonnex and Josh Stabback. We both live around Victoria, BC, and have created this with no financial backing or connection to any MPs or parties.

## Why was it created?

It's hard to find unbiased information about elected representatives, especially during campaign time. We wanted to attempt to create a resource that would only be based on the proven voting records of MPs.

## How does it work?

## How do you account for bias?

### Our bias

First, it's important to acknowledge that all information has bias. Both the creators generally skew left-wing, but we've attempted to be as unbiased as we can.

### Strategies for countering bias

While the [Methodology](/canada/methodology) page goes into more detail, here are some of the strategies we use to counter bias:

- We only use official voting records from the House of Commons.
- We only use official bill texts from the House of Commons.
- We've attempted to influence the AI summarization to ensure that the summaries are as unbiased as possible.
- We've avoided passing the MP's names to the AI summarization, so that the summaries are not influenced by the historical news coverage of MPs.
- We've avoided passing the names of any political parties to the AI summarization, so that the summaries are not influenced by the historical news coverage of parties.
