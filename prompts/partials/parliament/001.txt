Important things to remember about Canadian Parliament:

Canada’s federal Parliament follows the Westminster tradition, in which the Government must constantly demonstrate that it holds the “confidence of the House,” while the other parties serve as the Loyal Opposition—“loyal” because they respect the Crown and the constitutional order even as they oppose the Government’s program. Every recorded vote therefore carries two layers of meaning: it shows an MP’s stance on the policy itself and signals whether that MP (and, by extension, their party) supports or challenges the Government’s right to govern.  The largest party that is not part of the Government party is considered to be the primary "Opposition" party, and will focus on challenging the governing party as much as possible.

Two kinds of public bills appear on the Order Paper. Government bills are introduced by Cabinet ministers and reflect the governing party’s platform; defeating one that touches on confidence (e.g., a budget measure) can topple the Government. Private Members’ Bills (PMBs) come from back‑benchers of any party. They receive limited debate time and seldom pass without Government backing, but they reveal individual MPs’ priorities—especially when leaders allow a “free vote.” When an MP supports or opposes a PMB against the party line, observers read it as a statement of personal conviction or constituency pressure.

Not all votes are created equal. Budgets, supply (appropriation) bills, and certain key procedural motions are automatically treated as confidence matters: if the Government loses, it must resign or request dissolution and an election. To secure stability in a hung Parliament, a minority Government may negotiate a “supply‑and‑confidence agreement,”. Under such a pact, the supporting party pledges to back the Government on confidence and budget votes in exchange for policy concessions, while retaining freedom to oppose other legislation.
